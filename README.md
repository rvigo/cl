# cl

cl (Command List) is a way to group all your `aliases`, `once a while` or `multiple usages with a lot of args` commands in an organized and human readable place

## usage
```bash
$ cl
```
yeah, simple like that

## how to install

for now, the only way to install is from source. So you must have `Rust` and `Cargo` installed ([please follow the official Rust site instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

* clone the project
* in the project root dir runs:
  ``` bash
  $ cargo install --path .
  ```

## disclaimer
this project is in an early development stage, so if you find some weird behavior, please open an `issue` describing what is happening
